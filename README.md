# Large-scale-Ising
This repository is the space to design a hierarchical Ising Machine (HIM) for the large-scale Combinatorial Optimization Problems. The first demonstration will be made for Traveling Salesman Problems.

In "Large-Scale-Ising.ipynb", a TSPlib is clustered, then solved by "ising" that is programmed by "Ising_Layer" from the higher-level clusters to the lower-level clusters.
