# Large-scale-Ising through Graph Partitioning
This branch is a test for the graph partition method, attempting to bypass the clustering operation in X-Ising. The basic Ising macro remains unchanged, but the way the Ising solutions are put together is completely changed. Most of the changes are in `Large-Scale-Ising_graph_partition.ipynb`.
